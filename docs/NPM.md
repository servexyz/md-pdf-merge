# MD-PDF-Merge

> ( Multiple markdown files ) => 1 PDF

NOTE: This currently breaks while trying to convert. Not sure why markdown-pdf is outputting blank PDFs. I've tried using different styles (using streams, using callbacks) and I've tried using different versions (8 & 7). Still not working. Not sure what I'm doing wrong here.

## Getting Started

**Install**

```bash

```

**Execute CLI**

```bash
npm start
```

**Test CLI**

```bash
npm run test
```

## Goal

1. Extract all markdown (`*.md`) files from directory
2. Convert those to PDF
3. Merge those PDFs into one PDF
